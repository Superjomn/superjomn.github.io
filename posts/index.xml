      <description>It is a steep learning curve to master Emacs lisp, there are mainly two issues in it from my experience
the lisp syntax and functional programming the fragmented methods and libraries For the 1st issue, it is easy to master the syntax after writing several programs and getting used to them, but for the 2nd one, one needs to take notes or remember something.
In this blog, I focus on the 2nd point and keep updating the notes of some methods and libraries that I think are essential for writing Emacs lisp packages.</description>
