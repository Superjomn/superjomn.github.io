## About me {#about-me}

Thank you for your interest.

I am a Deep Learning system architect at NVIDIA, and my current focus is high-performance AI Compiler(on GPU).

Before this, I was a senior engineer in Baidu, working as an architect on PaddlePaddle (one of the most popular open-sourced deep learning frameworks in China market).

I was the creator &amp; primary author &amp; tech lead of the following projects in PaddlePaddle ecosystem (before 2022-6)

-   [Paddle-Inference](<https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/Paddle/tree/v2.3.2/paddle/fluid/inference>) - the server-class DL inference engine,
-   [Paddle-Lite](<https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/Paddle-Lite/tree/v2.11>) - A on-device inference engine with high-performance, tiny deployment size,
-   [Paddle-CINN](<https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/CINN>) - A DL compiler for automatically generating high-performance kernels &amp; programs for AI models,
-   [Paddle/infrt](<https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/Paddle/tree/v2.3.2/paddle/infrt>) - A unified architecture for both server-class and mobile devices, powered by MLIR, highly modular design,
-   [Paddle-VisualDL](<https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/VisualDL>) - A visualization tool for AI model,
-   [Paddle/continuous_evaluation](<https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/continuous_evaluation>) - A system that continuously traces the indicators modeling the performance of AI models.
