      <description>About me Thanks for your interest here.
I am a DL architect at NVIDIA, and my current focus is high-performance AI Compiler(on GPU).
Before this, I was a senior engineer in Baidu, working as an architect on PaddlePaddle (one of the most popular open-sourced deep learning frameworks in China market).
I was the creator &amp;amp; primary author &amp;amp; tech lead of the following projects in PaddlePaddle ecosystem (before 2022-6)
Paddle-Inference - the server-class DL inference engine, Paddle-Lite - A on-device inference engine with high-performance, tiny deployment size, Paddle-CINN - A DL compiler for automatically generating high-performance kernels &amp;amp; programs for AI models, Paddle/infrt - A unified architecture for both server-class and mobile devices, powered by MLIR, highly modular design, Paddle-VisualDL - A visualization tool for AI model, Paddle/continuous_evaluation - A system that continuously traces the indicators modeling the performance of AI models.</description>
